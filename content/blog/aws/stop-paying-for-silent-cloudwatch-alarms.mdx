Amazon CloudWatch alarms are essential for reliability. They are also billed per alarm

and per metric—regardless of whether they trigger. In busy AWS environments, alarms

proliferate via Auto Scaling, CloudFormation, and service defaults. The result is alarm

sprawl: thousands of alarms that never notify anyone, never transition state, and never

get cleaned up. 

To piggyback on the famous expression, if a CloudWatch Alarm goes off in a forest and nobody hears it,

do you still want to pay for it?

In this post, we cover CloudWatch alarm pricing, the most common waste patterns,

and how CloudFix identifies and helps you clean up unused alarms safely.

# Pricing of CloudWatch Alarms

Let's do a quick overview of CloudWatch alarm pricing. This data is available from the [AWS CloudWatch Pricing Page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

-   [Standard Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html): $0.10 per alarm per month (60-second evaluation)
-   [High-Resolution Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html): $0.30 per alarm per month (10–30 second evaluation)
-   [Composite Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html): $0.50 per alarm per month
-   [Anomaly Detection Alarms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Anomaly_Detection_Alarm.html): ~$0.30 per alarm per month (uses 3 metrics)
-   [GetMetricData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html) API: $0.0651 per 1,000 metrics requested
-   [SNS Notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.html): $0.50 per million notification.

> **Critical detail:** you pay for alarms by their existence, not by activity. Dormant alarms still incur monthly charges.

_[Mass Remove Cloudwatch Alarms for Non-Existant Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/49tkta/mass_remove_cloudwatch_alarms_for_nonexistant/)_

This is just a small sample of AWS users who have came across this issue. Note that one of the Reddit posts are 10 years old! Clearly, we are on to something. In the Stack Overflow post, we are seeing that people are trying to automate this. At CloudFix, we've already done this work, tested it, and delivered serious savings for our customers.

# CloudFix CloudWatch Alarm Cleanup Points

-   Alarms cost money whether they trigger or not
-   Two dominant waste categories:
-   Alarms stuck in `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` for 30+ days (metrics disappeared or resources deleted)
-   Alarms with no notification targets (no `AlarmActions`, `OKActions`, `InsufficientDataActions`)
-   In enterprise accounts, alarm sprawl routinely reaches thousands of alarms
-   Real cost impact: documented cases show thousands of dollars wasted annually

## A Concrete Example

An enterprise account discovered ~5,000 unused alarms across regions and accounts. Between standard, high-resolution, composite, and anomaly-detection alarms, their costs averaged out to roughly $1.60/alarm/month—about $8,000 per month. Deleting dormant and no-target alarms eliminated that spend while preserving meaningful monitoring.

# How CloudFix's Alarm Cleanup Finder/Fixers Work

## Finding Alarm Waste

We analyze CloudWatch alarms across accounts and regions using `DescribeAlarms` and `DescribeAlarmHistory`. We look for two patterns:

### Unused Alarms (`INSUFFICIENT_DATA`)

-   State: `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`
-   History: No transitions to `OK` or `ALARM` over a configurable lookback (default 30 days)
-   Common causes: terminated EC2s, renamed metrics/dimensions, disabled publishing

### No-Target Alarms

-   No actions configured: empty `AlarmActions`, `OKActions`, and `InsufficientDataActions`
-   Age gate: older than a configurable threshold (default 30 days)

For both categories, we apply sensible guardrails (e.g., minimum alarm inventory in a region, age thresholds) to ensure we only flag clear-cut waste.

## Estimating Cost and Savings

We combine your alarm inventory with regional price points to estimate current monthly costs and potential savings. At scale, even a modest number of high-resolution or composite alarms can materially shift spend.

## The Cleanup Process

Cleaning up alarms is simple and reversible (you can recreate alarms any time):

\# List candidate alarms (example)

aws cloudwatch describe-alarms \\
    --state-value INSUFFICIENT\_DATA \\
    --query'MetricAlarms\[\].AlarmName' | cat

## Delete specific alarms

aws cloudwatch delete-alarms \\
    --alarm-names "my-stale-alarm-1" "my-stale-alarm-2"

Tip: Before deleting, export alarm definitions you want to keep using your IaC (e.g., CloudFormation/Terraform) or by saving `describe-alarms` output.

## Multi-Account and Multi-Region

Alarm sprawl is usually multi-account and multi-region. CloudFix scans across your

organization and summarizes waste and savings with per-account and per-region rollups.
