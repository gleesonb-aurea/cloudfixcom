Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a powerful and scalable file storage service, but its Standard storage class can be costly at $0.30 per GB per month. CloudFix can help you optimize these costs by automatically enabling EFS Intelligent-Tiering, which can save up to 92% on storage costs for infrequently accessed files.

## Overview

EFS Intelligent-Tiering is a feature that automatically moves infrequently accessed files to a lower-cost storage tier while maintaining immediate access when needed. This CloudFix fixer identifies eligible EFS file systems and enables Intelligent-Tiering to optimize your storage costs without impacting performance.

## How It Works

The fixer implements a two-part lifecycle management policy:

-   Transition to Infrequent Access (IA): Files not accessed for 30 days are automatically moved to the IA storage class
-   Transition from IA: Files are automatically moved back to the Standard storage class upon first access

## Benefits

-   Up to 92% cost savings on infrequently accessed files
-   Automatic optimization with no manual intervention required
-   No impact on file accessibility or performance for frequently accessed data
-   Zero downtime during implementation

## Prerequisites

Your EFS file system must meet these criteria:

-   No existing lifecycle policy for Transition to IA
-   For Bursting throughput mode:
    -   Average IO for past 30 days < 90% of baseline throughput (Standard storage class)
    -   Average IO for past 30 days < 40% of baseline throughput (One Zone storage class)

## Implementation Details

When executed, the fixer performs these actions:

1.  For file systems with bursting throughput mode:
    -   Changes mode to Provisioned
    -   Sets Provisioned Throughput to match minimum required throughput
2.  Configures Lifecycle Management rules:
    -   Enables transition to IA after 30 days of inactivity
    -   Enables transition from IA on first access
3.  Monitors throughput via CloudWatch and increases provisioned throughput by 10% when needed

## Important Considerations

-   Files in IA storage class do not accrue burst credits
-   IA access incurs a per-GB retrieval fee
-   Throughput requirements should be monitored after implementation
-   Storage class transitions only occur between corresponding tiers (Standard ↔ Standard-IA, One Zone ↔ One Zone-IA)

## Rollback Process

While automatic rollback is not available, you can manually reverse the changes by:

-   Disabling IA to prevent new files from moving to IA storage class
-   Accessing files to trigger their transition out of IA storage class
-   Reverting to Bursting throughput mode if that was the original configuration

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does enabling Intelligent-Tiering require downtime?**

No, the implementation can be done without any system downtime.

**Q: Can CloudFix implement this automatically?**

Yes, once you accept the recommendation, CloudFix can automatically implement the changes.

**Q: What happens to my existing files?**

Existing files will be evaluated based on their access patterns and moved to IA storage if they haven't been accessed for 30 days.
