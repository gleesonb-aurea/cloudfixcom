AWS Lambda functions running on x86 architectures can now be seamlessly migrated to Graviton2 processors for up to 20% cost savings while also updating outdated runtimes. CloudFix's Lambda Retype Graviton With Runtime Upgrade Finder/Fixer automatically identifies eligible Lambda functions and handles both the architecture migration and runtime updates in one efficient operation.

## What Does This Finder/Fixer Do?

This Finder/Fixer identifies AWS Lambda functions that can benefit from two cost-saving and performance-enhancing changes:

-   Migration from x86 architecture to ARM-based Graviton2 processors
-   Update of deprecated or outdated runtimes to newer versions compatible with Graviton2

By performing both optimizations simultaneously, CloudFix delivers compounded benefits - reduced costs from the Graviton architecture and improved security and performance from the runtime updates.

## Why Is This Important?

Many organizations are running Lambda functions on older runtimes that are approaching or have already reached their end-of-support dates:

-   Node.js 14.x (Deprecated: December 4, 2023)
-   Python 3.7 (Deprecated: December 4, 2023)
-   Java 8 (Deprecated: January 8, 2024)
-   Node.js 16.x (Will be deprecated: June 12, 2024)

Running on deprecated runtimes creates security vulnerabilities and prevents you from accessing the latest performance improvements and features. Additionally, x86-based Lambda functions cost more to run than their Graviton2 counterparts, with the same performance or better in most cases.

## How Does The Finder Work?

CloudFix uses a comprehensive set of evaluators to identify Lambda functions suitable for migration:

1.  **Architecture Analysis**: Identifies Lambda functions running on x86 architectures that could be migrated to Graviton2.
2.  **Runtime Validation**: Flags functions using deprecated or outdated runtimes and determines the appropriate newer version.
3.  **Compatibility Check**: Analyzes function configurations and dependencies to ensure compatibility with Graviton2.
4.  **Cost Impact Assessment**: Calculates potential savings based on current usage patterns.

Functions are only recommended for migration when they pass all compatibility checks and show meaningful cost savings potential.

## What Happens When The Fixer Runs?

The Fixer performs two sequential operations on each approved Lambda function:

1.  **Runtime Upgrade**: Updates the function's runtime to the latest supported version compatible with Graviton2.
2.  **Architecture Migration**: Changes the architecture parameter from x86\_64 to arm64 (Graviton2).

These changes are executed through AWS Systems Manager Change Manager, providing a complete audit trail and rollback capabilities to ensure safety and compliance.

## Benefits

-   **Cost Reduction**: Up to 20% lower costs for Lambda function execution.
-   **Modern Runtime Security**: Ensures your functions run on supported runtimes with the latest security patches.
-   **Improved Performance**: Graviton2 processors can provide better performance for many workloads.
-   **Future-Proofing**: Stay ahead of runtime deprecation deadlines automatically.
-   **Simplified Management**: Single-click solution for both architecture and runtime optimization.

## Potential Risks

CloudFix conducts thorough compatibility checks, but some considerations should be kept in mind:

-   **Architecture-Specific Dependencies**: Functions with x86-specific binaries or libraries may not work on Graviton.
-   **Runtime Breaking Changes**: Newer runtime versions might have breaking changes requiring code updates.
-   **Function Behavior**: While rare, some workloads might behave differently on Graviton2 architecture.

CloudFix validates all these aspects before recommending migration, but it's good practice to monitor function performance post-migration.

## Cost Savings

Lambda functions migrated to Graviton2 architecture typically achieve up to 20% cost savings. The actual savings depends on your Lambda usage patterns, but in a typical enterprise AWS environment with hundreds or thousands of Lambda functions, the cumulative savings can be substantial.

Example: A Lambda function consuming $1,000 annually could save approximately $200 after migration to Graviton2.

## FAQ

**Is it possible to roll back after the migration?**

Yes, you can revert to the original architecture and runtime through the AWS Management Console or CLI if needed.

**Does the migration cause function downtime?**

Minimal downtime might occur during the migration process as function configurations are updated. The actual impact depends on your invocation patterns and deployment settings.

**Will all Lambda functions benefit from Graviton migration?**

Not all functions are suitable candidates. CloudFix targets functions with significant cost impact (typically those with annual costs of $10 or more) and verifies compatibility with Graviton architecture before recommending migration.

**How does CloudFix validate compatibility with Graviton?**

CloudFix analyzes your Lambda function's configuration, similar to the AWS Porting Advisor for Graviton, to ensure they don't use x86-specific libraries or binaries that would be incompatible with ARM architecture.
