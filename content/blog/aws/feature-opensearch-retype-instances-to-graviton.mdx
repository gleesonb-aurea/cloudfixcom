[Amazon OpenSearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/)

## Opportunity Description

CloudFix identifies OpenSearch domains running on Intel-based instances (M5, C5, R5) that can be migrated to AWS Graviton2 processors. Graviton2-based instances offer a 10% cost reduction while providing significant performance improvements: 38% better indexing throughput, 50% lower indexing latency, and 30% improved query performance.

## How It Works

1.  Finder Phase:
    -   Identifies OpenSearch domains running Elasticsearch 7.9+ or any OpenSearch version
    -   Checks for on-demand instances in M, C, or R families
    -   Verifies cluster eligibility for Graviton migration
    -   Calculates potential cost savings
2.  Fixer Phase:
    -   Validates cluster health status
    -   Performs blue/green deployment to minimize downtime
    -   Migrates to equivalent Graviton2 instance type (C6g, M6g, or R6g)
    -   Monitors migration progress and health metrics

## Key Benefits

-   **Cost Reduction:** 10% savings on instance costs
-   **Performance Boost:**
    -   38% better indexing throughput
    -   50% lower indexing latency
    -   30% improved query performance
-   **Minimal Disruption:** Blue/green deployment strategy
-   **Automated Migration:** Handles instance type mapping automatically

## Important Considerations

-   **Version Requirements:**
    -   Elasticsearch version 7.9 or higher
    -   Any OpenSearch version
-   **Maintenance Window:** Schedule migration during off-peak hours
-   **Health Checks:** Automated verification before and after migration
-   **Rollback Option:** Manual rollback possible if needed
