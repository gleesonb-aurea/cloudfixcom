## Finding savings: What are orphaned snapshots?

When you delete an EBS volume, any existing snapshots of the volume remain. These are called “orphaned” snapshots. As long as these orphaned snapshots are not used for other purposes, they can safely be deleted to cut costs. When deleting EC2 instances or EBS volumes, it is easy to forget about their backups. EBS snapshots cost **$0.05/GB per month**, so maintaining orphaned snapshots can accrue unnecessary costs.

## Realizing savings: How deleting orphaned snapshots lowers your costs

Orphaned snapshots can be removed if you use EC2 Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to create backups of your EC2 instances. DLM will not automatically delete orphaned snapshots for you. You can read [more information here](https://awsmadeeasy.com/blog/reduce-aws-ebs-costs-orphaned-snapshots/) on how to identify and remove orphaned EBS snapshots. With this fix in place, you can be sure that you are never paying for orphaned EBS snapshots that do not serve any development or archival purposes.
