AWS Reserved Instance and Savings Plan Policy Changes: What You Need to Know

## AWS has announced significant changes to their Reserved Instance (RI) and Savings Plans (SP) policies that will take effect June 1, 2025. These changes impact how Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and resellers can share commitments across customer accounts. Here’s what you need to know.

Official AWS Communication

Below is the full correspondence from AWS regarding these changes:

> _Dear AWS Partner,_
> 
> _As a valued partner, we appreciate your collaboration and commitment to driving growth and innovation using AWS services. We are writing to inform you of our policies regarding Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans (SPs)._
> 
> _Amazon EC2 RIs and SPs provide savings for a single end customer’s long-term steady state AWS usage, enabling AWS to deliver the lowest possible prices for RIs and SPs. We are updating our program terms to clearly reflect that RIs and SPs are only for a single end customer’s AWS usage._
> 
> _We plan to make these program terms effective beginning on June 1, 2025, giving partners time to update their business practices and plan any necessary communications._
