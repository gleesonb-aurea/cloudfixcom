We're excited to unveil our latest feature enhancement: Customizable Email Notifications, bringing the power of granular filtering directly to your inbox!

## **Hear from Our Experts**

Join CloudFix Chief Evangelist Stephen Barr and CloudFix Customer Champion Bill Gleeson as they give a quick overview of this powerful new feature, as they show you how CloudFixâ€™s Customizable Email Notifications can help ensure AWS resource owners have relevant updates on potential cost savings across their AWS services.

## **Feature Summary**

-   Create custom notifications based on tags, recommendation types, resource types, and more
-   Filter alerts by organizational units, AWS accounts, and regions
-   Set up targeted weekly alerts for top cost-saving opportunities
-   Enjoy the same detailed filtering options as your CloudFix dashboard

## **Why It Matters**

AWS cost management across large organizations is complex, especially when new services or features are added to your infrastructure. Our configurable notifications ensure that our cost optimization recommendations can be surfaced to those in a position to take action on them. For example, you can configure notifications related to Amazon RDS to go to a central databases team who can apply company-wide policy. CloudFix produces right-sizing recommendations for EC2 instances, and these notifications can be sent directly to the instance owners. If you have application-level tagging, you can send notifications to the application owner or DevOps team.

## **Comparison to** **AWS Budgets****,** **AWS Billing Alerts** **and Cost Anomaly Detection**

AWS Budgets are for tracking your costs against forecasted spend. They are useful for comparing realized to forecasted and historical spend. [AWS Billing Alerts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html) are great and we recommend that you set these up. However, by default AWS billing alerts are sent to the account owner. As AWS usage grows within an organization, the account owner often does not directly control the resource. Thus, you will need to configure billing alerts to be sent to the correct party. And, most importantly, billing alerts simply alert when spend crosses a threshold. This may or may not be actionable, and the user will need to further investiate.

Similarly, [AWS Cost Anomaly Detection](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-anomaly-detection/) can let you know when spend metrics are outside of your standard AWS usage patterns. Similar to billing alerts, this is good information but not necessarily actionable. For example, a spike in usage may cause a cost anomaly, but this may be a good thing, for example a spike in popularity in your application.

## **Key Benefits**

-   **Precision**: Receive alerts configured to your specific needs, down to individual tags
-   **Efficiency**: Focus on the most critical cost-saving opportunities without constant manual checks
-   **Consistency**: Align your email alerts with dashboard preferences
-   **Time-****saving**: Eliminate irrelevant notifications and get information pushed to you
-   **Flexibility**: Easily monitor new additions to your infrastructure, like a new OpenSearch layer

## **How It Works**

1.  **Tag-Based Filtering**: Use existing tags in your AWS infrastructure to create targeted alerts. For example, tag resources by product name, environment, or owner.
2.  **Customizable Alerts**: Set up weekly emails highlighting your top three cost-saving opportunities, filtered by your chosen tags.
3.  **Detailed Information**: Each alert includes full information about the resources, potential savings, and current waste.
4.  **One-Click Resolution**: Use the "Resolve" link in the email to quickly navigate to the resource in CloudFix and take action by applying the Fixer.
5.  **Webhook Integration**: In addition to emails, set up webhooks to send alerts to platforms like Slack for team-wide visibility.

## **Example** **Use Case**

Imagine you've just added a new OpenSearch functionality to your application. You can:

1.  Tag all related resources with a specific identifier (e.g., "new-opensearch-feature")
2.  Set up a CloudFix email alert using this tag
3.  Receive notifications only about cost-saving opportunities related to this new feature
4.  Quickly optimize your new infrastructure without sifting through unrelated alerts

This targeted approach allows you to maintain optimal performance and cost-efficiency, especially for new or changing parts of your infrastructure.
