AWS ElastiCache typically requires large memory allocations to handle data storage. However, CloudFix has identified that many ElastiCache clusters can benefit from enabling data tiering, a cost-saving feature that optimizes your memory usage by moving less frequently accessed data from expensive in-memory storage (RAM) to lower-cost SSD storage.

## What is ElastiCache Data Tiering?

ElastiCache data tiering is a feature for Redis clusters that allows you to significantly reduce costs by storing less frequently accessed data on lower-cost SSD storage instead of keeping all data in memory. This approach optimizes your infrastructure costs while maintaining performance for your workloads.

Data tiering allows you to manage larger datasets with fewer and/or smaller memory-optimized nodes, as it automatically manages the movement of data between memory and SSD based on access patterns.

## How it Works

Data tiering in ElastiCache operates using these key principles:

-   **Automatic data placement:** The Redis engine automatically places your most accessed (hot) data items in memory, while less frequently accessed (cold) data is moved to SSD storage.
-   **LRU-based movement:** A Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm determines which data remains in memory and which is moved to SSD.
-   **Keys remain in memory:** All keys remain in memory for quick lookups, but values can be tiered to SSD, resulting in optimal performance.
-   **Minimal latency impact:** When a value is needed from SSD storage, it's retrieved with a slight latency increase (around 300Î¼s) compared to memory access.
-   **Node type requirement:** Data tiering is available on r6gd node types that include both memory and NVMe SSDs.

## AWS Services Affected

This CloudFix feature interacts with the following AWS services:

[Amazon ElastiCache](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/WhatIs.html)

This feature specifically targets Amazon ElastiCache for Redis clusters that could benefit from implementing data tiering. CloudFix analyzes your Redis clusters to identify opportunities where enabling data tiering can significantly reduce costs without affecting application performance.

## Benefits

Enabling data tiering for your ElastiCache Redis clusters provides several key benefits:

-   **Significant cost savings:** Customers have seen up to 60% reduction in memory costs with no noticeable performance degradation.
-   **Larger datasets, smaller footprint:** Store more data with fewer or smaller memory-optimized nodes.
-   **Automatic optimization:** The LRU algorithm automatically manages data placement with no application changes required.
-   **Maintained performance:** Critical hot data stays in memory, while cold data on SSD is still accessible with minimal latency increase.
-   **Simplified scaling:** Accommodate growing datasets without proportionally increasing memory costs.

## Opportunity Criteria

CloudFix identifies ElastiCache clusters suitable for data tiering based on the following criteria:

1.  Redis ElastiCache cluster must be running Redis version 6.2 or later.
2.  Cluster workload characteristics show that a significant portion of data remains unused in memory (i.e., low hit ratios or large memory footprint with low activity).
3.  Current instance types are more expensive than equivalent r6gd types that support data tiering.
4.  Sufficient metrics are available to analyze memory usage and assess data temperature (hot vs. cold).

## How CloudFix Helps

CloudFix simplifies the process of identifying and implementing data tiering for your ElastiCache Redis clusters:

1.  **Find:** CloudFix automatically scans your AWS environment to identify ElastiCache Redis clusters that would benefit from data tiering.
2.  **Analyze:** For each identified cluster, CloudFix calculates potential cost savings based on your specific usage patterns and instance types.
3.  **Guide:** CloudFix provides detailed migration guidance with specific steps for enabling data tiering on your clusters.
4.  **Monitor:** After implementing data tiering, CloudFix continues monitoring performance to ensure optimal configuration.

Note: This Finder currently does not have an automatic Fixer. Enabling data tiering requires manual steps that involve modifying the cluster to use compatible r6gd instance types and configuring data tiering settings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does implementing data tiering require downtime?**

Yes. Transitioning to new instance types and enabling tiering may require restarting or recreating clusters, resulting in downtime. Plan the change during maintenance windows.

**Q: Is it possible to roll back once data tiering is enabled?**

Yes. You can revert to non-tiered nodes by modifying the instance type and disabling the data tiering configuration. However, this involves downtime and reconfiguration.

**Q: What types of workloads benefit most from data tiering?**

Workloads with clear hot/cold data patterns benefit most. Ideal candidates include applications where approximately 20% of data is frequently accessed and the remaining 80% is accessed infrequently. Large datasets (over 500GB) also typically see greater benefits.

**Q: Will my application code need to change to support data tiering?**

No. Data tiering is transparent to your application code. No changes are required as the Redis engine automatically manages the data placement between memory and SSD.
