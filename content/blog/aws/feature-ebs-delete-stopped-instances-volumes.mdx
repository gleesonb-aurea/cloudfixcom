## Overview

### Key Benefits

-   Reduce storage costs by removing unnecessary volumes
-   Automatic snapshot creation for data safety
-   Easy rollback process if needed
-   Compliance with AWS best practices

## AWS Services Affected

![AWS EC2 icon](/media/uploads/EC2.svg)

[Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html)

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)

### Dependencies

-   [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) (for monitoring)
-   [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) (for logging)

### Service Limits

-   Maximum number of concurrent volume deletions
-   API rate limits for volume operations
-   Snapshot storage limits

## How It Works

### Finder Component

-   Identifies volumes attached to stopped instances
-   Checks instance stop duration
-   Calculates potential cost savings
-   Verifies volume eligibility

### Fixer Component

-   Creates snapshots of selected volumes
-   Detaches volumes from instances
-   Deletes eligible volumes
-   Records actions in CloudTrail

## Implementation Details

The implementation process involves:

1.  Volume Analysis
    -   Identify target volumes
    -   Check instance status
    -   Verify dependencies
2.  Snapshot Creation
    -   Create volume snapshots
    -   Verify snapshot completion
    -   Tag snapshots appropriately
3.  Volume Cleanup
    -   Detach volumes
    -   Delete volumes
    -   Update metadata

## Important Considerations

-   Snapshot storage costs
-   API rate limits
-   Regional restrictions
-   Recovery time objectives

## Safety and Rollback

### Safety Measures

-   Automatic snapshot creation
-   Volume metadata preservation
-   CloudTrail logging
-   Staged implementation

### Rollback Process

-   Create new volume from snapshot
-   Attach volume to instance
-   Verify data integrity
