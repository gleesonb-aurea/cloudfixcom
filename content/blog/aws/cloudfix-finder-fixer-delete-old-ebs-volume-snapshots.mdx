### Key Benefits

-   Reduce storage costs by removing unnecessary snapshots
-   Maintain data safety through careful snapshot selection
-   Automated identification of old snapshots
-   Easy rollback process if needed

## AWS Services Affected

![AWS EC2 icon](/media/uploads/EC2.svg)

[Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html)

[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)

### Dependencies

-   [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html) (for monitoring)
-   [AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html) (for logging)

### Service Limits

-   Maximum number of concurrent snapshot deletions
-   API rate limits for snapshot operations

## How It Works

### Finder Component

-   Identifies old EBS snapshots
-   Checks snapshot dependencies
-   Calculates potential cost savings
-   Verifies snapshot eligibility for deletion

### Fixer Component

-   Validates snapshot selection
-   Checks for dependent AMIs or volumes
-   Deletes eligible snapshots
-   Records actions in CloudTrail

## Implementation Details

The implementation process involves:

1.  Snapshot Analysis
    -   Identify old snapshots
    -   Check snapshot age
    -   Verify dependencies
2.  Safety Verification
    -   Check for AMI dependencies
    -   Verify no active volumes
    -   Confirm snapshot age threshold
3.  Snapshot Cleanup
    -   Delete eligible snapshots
    -   Update CloudWatch metrics
    -   Log deletion actions

## Important Considerations

-   Snapshot dependencies
-   Recovery requirements
-   Regional restrictions
-   API rate limits

## Safety and Rollback

### Safety Measures

-   Dependency checking
-   Age threshold validation
-   CloudTrail logging
-   Staged implementation

### Rollback Process

-   Note: Snapshot deletions cannot be directly rolled back
-   Maintain good snapshot management practices
-   Consider creating archive copies of critical snapshots
