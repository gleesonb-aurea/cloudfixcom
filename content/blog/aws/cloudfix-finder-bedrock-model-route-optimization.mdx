Amazon Bedrock offers multiple foundation model providers for generative AI workloads, each with different pricing and performance characteristics. This CloudFix Finder helps you identify cost-saving opportunities by analyzing your Bedrock usage patterns and recommending lower-cost model routes that can deliver equivalent results.

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock provides access to various foundation models from providers like Anthropic, AI21, and Stability AI. While these models offer similar capabilities, their pricing and performance characteristics can vary significantly. This Finder analyzes your Bedrock usage patterns and identifies opportunities to optimize costs by suggesting alternative model routes that can deliver comparable results at lower prices.

## How It Works

### Finder Component

The Finder analyzes your Bedrock usage by:

-   Identifying high-frequency model routes in your workloads
-   Analyzing workload types (text generation, summarization, image generation, etc.)
-   Evaluating performance requirements and constraints
-   Comparing costs across compatible model providers
-   Generating recommendations for cost-effective alternatives
-   Providing side-by-side comparisons of costs and characteristics

### Implementation Guide

To implement the recommended changes:

1.  Review the Finder’s recommendations and cost-benefit analysis
2.  Update your application code or API configuration to use the suggested alternative model
3.  Conduct thorough testing to validate:
    -   Output quality and consistency
    -   Performance metrics
    -   Integration compatibility
4.  Deploy the changes following your standard CI/CD practices
5.  Monitor the new model route’s performance and costs

## FAQ

### What are the potential savings?

Customers typically see 10-30% cost reduction when switching to optimized model routes, particularly for large-scale generative AI workloads. The exact savings depend on your usage volume and the price difference between the current and recommended models.

### Is this change automatic?

No. This is a Finder-only feature that requires manual implementation. CloudFix provides detailed recommendations and comparisons, but you’ll need to update your application code or API configuration to implement the changes.

### Can changes be rolled back?

Yes. You can revert to your original model route by restoring the previous API configuration or redeploying your prior model integration.

### Does this change require downtime?

No. When following standard CI/CD and deployment practices, you can implement API configuration changes without service interruption.

### How do you ensure quality isn’t compromised?

The Finder carefully evaluates workload characteristics and avoids suggesting model switches for performance-critical or high-accuracy applications without verified performance comparisons. We recommend thorough testing of any alternative model before production deployment.
