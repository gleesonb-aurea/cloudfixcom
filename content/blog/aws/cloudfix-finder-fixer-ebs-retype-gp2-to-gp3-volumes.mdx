## Overview

-   Problem: Many AWS accounts still use gp2 volumes when gp3 would provide better performance at lower cost
-   Solution: Automated identification and conversion of eligible gp2 volumes to gp3
-   Benefits: Up to 20% cost reduction while maintaining or improving performance

## AWS Services Affected

## How It Works

### Finder Component

-   Detection Method: Scans your AWS environment for gp2 volumes
-   Resource Analysis: Evaluates volume performance metrics and usage patterns
-   Identification Criteria: Determines volumes where gp3 would provide equal or better performance at lower cost

### Fixer Component

-   Implementation: Uses AWS Systems Manager for secure, automated conversion
-   Safety Measures: Validates volume eligibility before conversion
-   Rollback Process: Maintains ability to revert to gp2 if needed

## AWS Services Details

-   Primary Service: Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
-   Dependencies: AWS Systems Manager for automation
-   Service Limits: Standard EBS volume modification quotas apply

## FAQ

**Will this affect my application performance?**

No. The Finder/Fixer ensures that the recommended conversions will maintain or improve performance. Gp3 volumes provide a baseline of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s throughput, which is suitable for most workloads.

**How much can I save?**

Savings typically range from 20% to 30% compared to gp2 pricing, depending on your volume size and configuration.

**Is there any downtime during the conversion?**

No. The conversion from gp2 to gp3 is performed seamlessly with no disruption to your applications.

**What are the best practices for this conversion?**

We recommend reviewing the volumes selected for conversion and testing the process on non-production volumes first. Monitor performance metrics after conversion to ensure optimal configuration.
