The snooze button - it can be the first thing you reach for on a sleepy morning to get a few more minutes. Snoozing can be relaxing, but it can also be a strategic way to manage cognitive overload. **CloudFix produces** **many savings recommendations**. We want you to execute _all_ of them, but at a pace that works for you. You should take the time to understand each one. If you don’t have time right now, but want to get back to the recommendation soon, we have introduced the ‘Snooze’ button.

Using the Snooze button, selected recommendations can be temporarily muted. This way, you can clear your plate of immediate suggestions, with the confidence that you will get them back later. This can be really helpful for keeping your dashboard stocked with recommendations you are planning to execute in the immediate future.

# **Why the Snooze Button?**

We are making Finder/Fixers at a rapid pace. And, your AWS Organization is growing at a rapid pace. Perhaps you have a centralized FinOps model, where a central FinOps team can publish migration guides and best practices. You could focus for a sprint or two on Graviton migration. During this time, it might be a good idea to snooze the other recommendations, so you can focus on that.

# **How to use it**

This may be our simplest feature yet. It’s just as simple as an alarm clock. You follow these simple steps:

## **1 - Select the Resources You Want to Snooze**

## ![01-select-resources](/media/uploads/01-select-resources-600x338.png)

## **2 - Click the Snooze Button**

![02-hit-snooze](/media/uploads/02-hit-snooze-600x338.png)

## **3 - Select the Number of Days to Snooze**

30, 60, 90, or permanently.

## **4 - Hit Confirm, and Lock in other Savings**

Once you hit confirm, you won’t see the selected alerts for the specified period of time. I hope that you use the time to lock in the savings in some other way!![](/media/uploads/04-confirm-600x338.png)

# Centralized FinOps Teams

Snoozing notifications may be a great way for Centralized FinOps teams to manage what they are working on. Combined with [our Jira integration](/blog/bringing-cost-optimization-to-your-teams-workflow-with-cloudfix-jira-integration/), this is a great way to stay organized. It can be a good idea to have a theme to a sprint or set of sprints. For example, you may spend a quarter working on Graviton migration; [Lambda Graviton](/blog/cloudfix-introduces-lambda-graviton-migration/), [RDS Graviton](/blog/graviton-added-to-the-rds-mysql-optimizer/), and porting your EC2 instances to Graviton. 

We hope that you get good use out of the snooze button!
