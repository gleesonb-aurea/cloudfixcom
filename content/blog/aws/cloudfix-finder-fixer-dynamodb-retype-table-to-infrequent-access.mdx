## Opportunity Description

DynamoDB offers two table classes: Standard and Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA). The Standard-IA table class provides significant cost savings for tables where storage costs are the primary expense rather than read/write operations. By analyzing your table’s usage patterns, CloudFix can identify opportunities to transition tables to Standard-IA, potentially reducing storage costs by up to 60%.

## How It Works

CloudFix’s DynamoDB Table Class Optimizer works in two phases:

### Finder Phase

-   Discovers all DynamoDB tables across your AWS accounts and regions
-   Analyzes 30-day historical usage patterns for each table
-   Calculates potential cost savings by comparing storage and access costs between Standard and Standard-IA classes
-   Identifies tables where transitioning to Standard-IA would result in cost savings

### Fixer Phase

-   Automatically transitions eligible tables to the Standard-IA class
-   Monitors table performance and usage patterns continuously
-   Can switch tables back to Standard class if usage patterns change
-   Respects AWS’s limit of two table class changes per 30 days

## Key Benefits

-   **Significant Cost Savings:** Reduce storage costs by up to 60% for eligible tables
-   **Zero Performance Impact:** No changes to table performance, durability, or availability
-   **Automated Optimization:** Continuous monitoring and automatic transitions based on usage patterns
-   **No Code Changes:** Works with existing applications without requiring any code modifications
-   **Bidirectional Optimization:** Can switch tables between Standard and Standard-IA classes based on cost-effectiveness

## Important Considerations

-   **Table Class Changes:** Limited to two changes per table within a 30-day period
-   **Cost Analysis:** Takes into account both storage and access costs to determine optimal table class
-   **Reserved Capacity:** Considers existing reserved capacity commitments when evaluating potential savings
-   **Access Patterns:** Standard-IA has higher costs for read/write operations but lower storage costs
-   **Continuous Evaluation:** CloudFix monitors usage patterns and adjusts table classes accordingly within AWS limits
